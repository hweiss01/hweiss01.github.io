I created 3 webpages kept in my github directory hweiss01.github.io.
These are index.html, resume.html, bio.html.
Each of these documents has a matching css stylesheet, so index.css, 
resume.css and bio.css.
I commited many times along the way, and made sure to check each
file with the validators so that I only got warnings, no errors. 
I also have an index.html page hosted in my Tufts CS acount and it redirects 
to my github site. 

resume.html:
has my name, education, coursework, job and research experience, skills and
activities. I have lots of rules for the matching stylesheet! Something I 
wanted to do but couldn't quite figure out was how to indent entire sections 
of my my resume. I tried a few things, like putting those sections in a 
<span class="indent"> but this resulted in errors when I tried to validate.

bio.html:
a short, sweet bio about me. 

index.html: this is my homepage and you can access it by typing 
http://hweiss01.github.io
it contains my name, a photo of catbug, instead of me, a link to my resume 
and to my bio.
