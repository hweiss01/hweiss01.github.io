<p> My name is Hayley Weiss and I am currently a senior at Tufts University double majoring in computer science and biology. During my undergraduate career I have pursued biological research using computational means. At Tufts University under Dr. Michael Levin, I helped build a program to analyze D'Arcy Thompson's Theory of Transformation. And at Drexel University College of Medicine under Dr. Simon Giszter, I worked on creating soft body musculoskeletal models to compare soft body dynamics to rigid body dynamics. In the future I'm interested in pursuing further studies, possibly computational neuroscience or computational biology. For now I am delighted to say that after graduation I have a job as a software engineer at Vecna Technologies, working on health tech and robotics. I'm very excited to join the professional computer science world!  </p>
